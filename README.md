This is Copier Application.

# I am making this because I wanted to copy in coding test ngl :)
So search the algorithm on another tab using search and copy the algorithm. :) :) :)

This is built entirely by C# and Avalonia

So this is what is included:

Absolutely! Here's a **summary of the features** you’ve built so far into your **Avalonia-based Copier App** — it’s already a really solid and useful tool! 🚀

## 🧠 Core Features

### ✅ Entry Management

* **Add Entries**: User can enter a title and text snippet.
* **Copy Button**: Copies the text content to the clipboard.
* **Edit Button**: Toggle between read-only and editable modes for each entry.
* **Remove Button**: Deletes the entry from the UI.
* **Clear All Button**: Deletes all entries with one click.

## 💾 Persistence

* **AutoSave on Close**: Entries are automatically saved to disk (in JSON format).
* **AutoLoad on Start**: Automatically loads saved entries from the last session.

---

## 📤 Data Export/Import

* **Export to JSON**: Saves all entries to a user-selected `.json` file.
* **Import from JSON**: Loads entries from a selected `.json` file and replaces current entries.

---

## 🖥️ Platform Integration

* **Desktop Shortcut Creation** (🔁 One-Time):

  * Windows: `.bat` launcher on desktop
  * Linux: `.desktop` file
  * macOS: Symlink on desktop
  * ✅ Skips creation if already done
  * ✅ Fully cross-platform, no external libraries required

---

## ✅ Tech Stack

* **Avalonia UI (XAML/C#)** for the cross-platform UI.
* **.NET 6/7/8** depending on your project.
* Uses only built-in libraries (safe, no external dependencies except Avalonia).
